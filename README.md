# Chess Functionality
Star Wars Chess is a complete chess program, including - chess engine, compatible Graphical User Interface (GUI), and AI functionality. 
This Chess game uses an alpha-beta pruning algorithm and board-piece evaluation to determine AI's moves. Alpha-beta pruning decreases the 
amount of work and time it takes for the AI to examine all of its possible moves.
# Alpha-Beta Pruning
Instead of a traditional search method of evaluating all options in a tree, alpha-beta pruning discards nodes that have no possibility of
beating a previously examined node. By decreasing the number of nodes searched, the time it takes to evaluate all the moves to a certain depth 
decreases significantly. The depth determines how many moves in advance the algorithm extends the tree.
